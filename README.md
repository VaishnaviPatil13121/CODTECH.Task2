Overview of the Project:

Objectives:
1. Simplify Grade Management: Provide an intuitive interface for tracking grades across different subjects or assignments.  
2. Accurate Grade Calculation: Ensure precise computation of averages, weighted averages, and GPA based on user input.  
3. Enhanced Data Representation: Display grades with meaningful insights, such as letter grades and GPA, to aid decision-making.  
4. Flexible Data Handling: Allow users to save and load grade data for future use.  
5. Improve Accessibility: Offer a user-friendly interface suitable for students, teachers, and parents.

Key Activities:
1. Requirements Analysis:
   - Define the grade input format (e.g., subject name, grade, weight).  
   - Choose a standard grading scale (e.g., 4.0 GPA scale, letter grade thresholds).  

2. Program Design:
   - Outline the program structure with clear modules: data input, calculations, and output.  
   - Plan optional features such as file handling and data visualization.  

3. Development:
   - Input Module: Allow users to input grades, weights, and subjects.  
   - Calculation Module:
     - Calculate the average grade and weighted average (if applicable).  
     - Convert numeric grades into letter grades and GPA.  
   - Output Module: Display results in an organized format with additional insights.  

4. Testing:
   - Verify that the program handles various input scenarios correctly.  
   - Ensure accurate calculations and proper handling of edge cases (e.g., missing or invalid data).  

5. Documentation:
   - Provide clear usage instructions and comments within the code.  

6. Optional Enhancements:
   - Implement file handling to save/load grades.  
   - Use graphs to visualize grade trends.  
   - Add multi-student management capabilities.  

Technology Used:
1. Programming Language:  
   - Python: Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and rich ecosystem of libraries.

2. Libraries:  
   - Core Python: For input/output, file handling, and calculations.  
   - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For optional data visualization (e.g., bar charts).  
   - Pandas: For data handling and manipulation (if extended functionality is required).  

3. Development Environment:  
   - IDEs such as PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.  

4. Storage(Optional):  
   - Text Files/CSV Files: For simple data saving and loading.  
   - SQLite: For more complex data management.  

5. Version Control:  
   - Git: For tracking changes and collaboration.
